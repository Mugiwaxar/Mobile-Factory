Date: 29/04/2020
  Bugfixes:
    - version 0.0.135: PASTING settings defaults to (always is?) current player.
        Blueprinting store vague details but
            tries to match when the ghost is built, as best as it can.
  Changes:
    - Bilka added support in newgame+. Mobile Factory surface and Control Center aren't reset.
  Bugfixes:
    - fix invalid player error on_research_finished (hopefully)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.135
Date: 28/04/2020
  Features:
    - blueprinting will transfer some settings (experimental):
        ***only can copy settings if the player blueprinting matches the set Deep Storages and Deep Tanks***
        ***however, if player has Storages/Tanks matching the copied filter, it will try to use them***
        ***attempted to make usable across saves (makes a guess if the exact Storage/Tank is not found)***
        Matter Interactor: (if matching) Deep Storage, (else) Deep Storage filter, self-filter (always set), Mode
        Fluid Interactor: (if matching) Deep Tank, (else) Deep Tank Filter, Mode. No temperature support at the moment.
  Changes:
    - check for necessary tiles, and error with specific message if we're missing any
    - Construction Jets can place Tiles
    - Construction Jets can queue 1000 ghost, but a "Jets" option permits <= 25,000 for mass tile placement
         (performance concern - I can increase max if it's not that bad)
    - "too many" ghosts keeps existing construction table, and ignores new ghosts (previously emptied the table)
    - "too many ghosts" is a localized string that prints only to MF owner that places ghosts
  Scripting:
    - use ghost.revive() instead of destroying and creating a thing for construction jets
    - the construction ghost table is global at present (but size option is not).
                  This is bad. Will try to get to it by next version. (ghosts should be stored per-player / MF)
